🏎️ Chassis Design & Analysis for ATV

This project focuses on the design, modeling, and structural analysis of an ATV chassis, combining strength, rigidity, and lightweight construction to withstand off-road stresses and dynamic loads. The chassis serves as the backbone of the vehicle, supporting the engine, suspension, wheels, and driver, while ensuring optimal load distribution and safety during high-speed maneuvers.

✨ Highlights

📐 CAD Modeling → Detailed 3D chassis created in SolidWorks/AutoCAD with precise geometry and assembly.

🧮 FEA Analysis → Performed in ANSYS Workbench to study stress, deformation, and torsional rigidity under realistic driving conditions.

⚙️ Material Optimization → Selected high-strength, lightweight materials to balance durability and performance.

🚀 Load Analysis → Verified structural integrity under static, dynamic, and off-road impact loads.

📊 Key Outcomes

Achieved minimal deformation and high torsional stiffness, ensuring safety and stability.

Optimized weight for better acceleration and handling without compromising strength.

Developed a robust engineering workflow combining design, simulation, and optimization.
